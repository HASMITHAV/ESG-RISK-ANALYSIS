### 📌 Project Overview
With increasing pressure on businesses to quantify and address ESG risks, this project explores how data science and machine learning can be leveraged to predict and analyze ESG risk levels. The study focuses on:

Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) metrics
Machine learning models to classify & predict risk levels
Business insights for sustainability-driven decision-making
Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling, this project provides actionable insights for organizations looking to improve their ESG performance.

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

#### Machine Learning Models:
- Classification: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Networks
- Clustering: K-Means, KNN
- Regression: Linear Regression for benchmarking

#### Feature Engineering:
-Interaction terms (e.g., Env_Social_Interaction)
-Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)
-Oversampling to balance risk categories

#### Visualization:
-Heatmaps, Boxplots, Scatter Plots, Pair Plots
-Feature Importance (Random Forest)
-ROC, Lift, and Gain Charts

#### Model Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC, RMSE

### 📈 Key Insights
Social Risk Score is the strongest predictor of ESG risk.
Environmental & Social risks are highly correlated, indicating the need for integrated ESG strategies.
Governance risks behave differently but remain critical for compliance & investor confidence.
Random Forest outperformed all models, achieving 98.07% accuracy, making it ideal for ESG classification.
Businesses should prioritize high-risk ESG areas to mitigate regulatory & reputational damage.

### 📌 Future Scope

🚀 The next steps for this project include:

- Building a real-time ESG risk monitoring dashboard
- Applying NLP techniques to analyze ESG reports
- Exploring time-series forecasting for ESG trends
- Enhancing interpretability with SHAP & LIME
